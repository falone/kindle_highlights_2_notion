## Disclaimer
I am not a professional programmer, but a hobbyist who writes code with ChatGPT and Gemini for my own needs. Therefore, this code may be funny, silly, or incorrect - I absolutely understand that. If you have any tips on how to improve it, I will be grateful for the hints, but I don't promise that I will be able to implement them.
